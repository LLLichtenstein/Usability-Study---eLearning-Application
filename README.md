# Usability-Study for an Animal Anatomy &amp; Physiology eLearning Application
> > For this usability study I created a Veterinary Anatomy and Physiology eLearning application targeted towards biological science undergraduates. As part of the project, I wrote supporting test documentation such as personas and scenarios, competitive analyses, storyboards, prototypes, and test protocols. I conducted usability interviews with the Paper Prototyping with Blank Pages technique with four undergraduate students at a local university. I statistically analyzed the test results and offered recommendations. <br><br>
> > I presented my study at a graduate student symposium at James Madison University, Harrisonburg, Virginia and at two New Jersey Institute of Technology graduate student events.<br><br>
> > This project was part of my Master's degree program in Professional and Technical Communication at New Jersey Institute of Technology. My effort on this project outperformed the course requirements and led to a Merit Award.

## THE DOCUMENTATION
### Research
> > ### Project Proposal
> > I mapped out the scope of my project in the Project Proposal including the product, client, problem statement, and user-activity methods. In addition, I specify that I will conduct a competitive analysis and heuristic evaluation of websites that meet my criteria of anatomy and physiology eLearning. <br>
> > https://github.com/LLLichtenstein/Usability-Study-for-an-eLearning-Application/blob/main/usability_project_proposal.pdf <br>
> > ### Competitive Analysis
> > For my competitive analysis I searched the internet for websites that exhibit eLearning for anatomy and physiology, both animal and human. Candidate websites were evaluated for specific criteria and narrowed down to twelve websites which were then evaluated heuristically. <br>

> > ### Heuristic Evaluation
> > Using Jakob Nielsensâ€™s 10 Heuristics, I performed a heuristic evaluation on the twelve candidate websites selected for the Competitive Analysis.

### Design
> > Storyboards of general structure and navigation were followed by development of the wireframe prototype in Adobe Illustrator.<br>
> > ### Persona
> > The persona I created for this eLearning application is a pre-veterinary student, Kimberley, who aspires to become a veterinarian. She uses the internet frequently to learn more about the veterinary sciences to augment her knowledge for both her studies and part-time job in a veterinary practice.<br>

> > ### Scenario
> > In this scenario Kimberley is preparing for an exam in her animal physiology class and chooses my eLearning application to learn more about the system she will be tested on.<br>
> > https://github.com/LLLichtenstein/Usability-Study-for-an-eLearning-Application/blob/main/usability_scenario.pdf <br>
> > ### Organization
> > In order to design the organization and navigation of my website I consulted my Heuristic Evaluation website candidates as well as animal anatomy and physiology books.<br>
> > https://github.com/LLLichtenstein/Usability-Study-for-an-eLearning-Application/blob/main/usability_organization.pdf <br>
> > ### Storyboards
> > I analyzed the layouts of Heuristic Evaluation candidate websites and incorporated the best ideas, in my opinion, into my design.<br>

### The Study
> > Two interview sessions were held; participants worked through 5 tasks, answered open and closed-ended questions, and commented on blank pages.<br>
> > ### Recruiting and Screening
